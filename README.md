Project Description: I want to code a top down, RPG game where there is a player who can move freely around the screen and attack enemies
while exploring the set map

GUI Design: in assets folder

5 Possible Features:
1. Movable character
2. Enemies
3. the ability to attack enemies
4. Obstical collisions
5. A game over screen when you die

Extra notes: this is a skeleton of the actual game I was planning on making. I was too ambitious with what I wanted to have in the game that
I ended up cutting out some of the features that UI would've liked to include. These features include, a lot system, animations, a final boss,
a soundtrack, and more. This is a project that I would definetly like to work on in the future and expand upon.
