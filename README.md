1. Movable character
2. Enemies
3. the ability to attack enemies
4. Obstical collisions
5. A game over screen when you die

Extra notes: I was trying to make something way more complex but I didn't have the knowledge nor the skill to accomplish such a task. I wanted to make an actual game with so many features such as a loot system, a map, a final boss, power-ups, and so much more but I was too ambitious and it came back to bite me. I had to really simplify the code so that I can have a running program to turn in. Its nothing great but it runs unlike what I previously had. I do plan on learning how to make a more complex game like the one I had envisioned before in the future so updates will be coming. Thank you for your cooperation Professor Moore by allowing me to edit my code past the deadline, I greatly appreciate it. I really enjoyed the class and you as a professor. I will definitely be recommending you to others in the future.
Thank you again,
